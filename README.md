# Flutter Code Execution Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to run Flutter code on your local machine. Flutter is an open-source framework developed by Google for building cross-platform applications. Before you begin, ensure that you have Flutter SDK installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

## Steps to Run Flutter Code

Follow the steps below to run the Flutter code:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Ensure that you have an emulator/device connected or running. You can use either a physical device or an emulator to run the Flutter application.

5. To start the application, run the following command:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will build and run the Flutter application on the connected device/emulator. The application will open automatically once the build process is complete.

6. Congratulations! You have successfully run the Flutter code on your local machine.

## Additional Information

- To build the Flutter application for a specific platform (Android or iOS), you can use the following commands:

  - Android: `flutter build apk`
  - iOS: `flutter build ios`

  The resulting build artifacts can be found in the `build` directory of your project.

- Flutter provides hot reload functionality, which allows you to see the changes in your code without restarting the application. To trigger a hot reload, simply save your changes in the code editor while the application is running.

For more information on Flutter and its features, please refer to the official [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs).
